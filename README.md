# RetailX Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of sales data from RetailX, a fictional retail company. The analysis was conducted using Jupyter Notebook and Power BI as part of a data analysis journey. The project aimed to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and trends to inform strategic decision-making within the company.
